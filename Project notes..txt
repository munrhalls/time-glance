TIME CARDS
Project notes

- rewriting dragover function from works fully well but is extremely resource-inefficient to works fully well and is fairly resource efficient
- highlightHours solution in hourColumns -> highlightParams and highlightBox with props solution

FIRST PLAN. NOS BS. SIMPLE STEPS. SUPER SMALL POINT BY SMALL POINT.
// REWRITE
    // detect in hourColumn but handle in day
    // 1. hourColumn's innerText ->  get hour num
    // 2. standardize hour unit
    // 3. multiply that by hour num
    // 4. from that, get width: card.duration * hour num
    // 5. create highlightBox component
    // 6. props width = card.duration * standard unit, marginLeft = hourNum * standard unit, color = card.color, pos absolute, height full

THEN DO. ALL IN 100% ON ONE SUPER SMALL POINT. ONE AT A TIME. LIKE LASER GOING FROM ONE TINIEST DOT TO THE NEXT ONE. NOT MANY-AT-ONCE.
